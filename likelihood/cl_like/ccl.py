"""
Simple CCL theory wrapper that returns the cosmology object
and optionally a number of methods depending only on that
object.

This is based on an earlier implementation by Antony Lewis:
https://github.com/cmbant/SZCl_like/blob/methods/szcl_like/ccl.py

`get_CCL` results a dictionary of results, where `results['cosmo']`
is the CCL cosmology object.

Classes that need other CCL-computed results (without additional
free parameters), should pass them in the requirements list.

e.g. a `Likelihood` with `get_requirements()` returning
`{'CCL': {'methods:{'name': self.method}}}`
[where self is the Likelihood instance] will have
`results['name']` set to the result
of `self.method(cosmo)` being called with the CCL cosmo
object.

The `Likelihood` class can therefore handle for itself which
results specifically it needs from CCL, and just give the
method to return them (to be called and cached by Cobaya with
the right parameters at the appropriate time).

Alternatively the `Likelihood` can compute what it needs from
`results['cosmo']`, however in this case it will be up to the
`Likelihood` to cache the results appropriately itself.

Note that this approach precludes sharing results other than
the cosmo object itself between different likelihoods.

Also note lots of things still cannot be done consistently
in CCL, so this is far from general.
